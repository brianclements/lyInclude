# lyInclude
Custom LilyPond code snippets and markup modifications for [lyTemplates][1].

## Overview
These files are intended to be bundled and used with the LilyPond templates
contained in lyTemplates. They include my custom code snippets and other
frequently used custom markup modifications for things like improvisation
slashes, rhythmic markings, and chord changes.

## Requirements
These templates were created and used extensively with LilyPond 2.14.2 and have
not yet been tested with newer versions. Some improvements to LilyPond regarding
[Jazz fonts][2] has been made, but I have not yet had a chance to explore their
possibilities with the modifications made here.
